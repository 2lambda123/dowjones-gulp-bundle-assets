## History

This plugin was originally forked from [gulp-bundle-assets](https://github.com/dowjones/gulp-bundle-assets) to fix a CSS import bug. It has since been entirely reworked to better suit the requirements of the UserFrosting's Sprinkle system and follow the Gulp plugin guidelines (namely not unncessarily depending on it).
